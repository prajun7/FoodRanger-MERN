# FoodRanger
FoodRanger is a local food delivery platform. They partner up with local restaurants and deliver food to the customerâ€™s doorstep.<br>
Upon landing on their website a user can search for restaurants by name or pre-defined area.<br>
Authenticated users can add reviews and add food items to their cart.<br>
Based on the search result, the user will be shown a list of matching restaurants.<br>

I am using the MERN stack to develop this program.  Using Node and Express for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.<br>

The endpoints that I have implemented in my REST API includes the following,<br>

Developed the frontend using React.js and built reusable React components that were used across multiple pages<br>
Adopted MongoDB for data storage, designed 5 different schemas, and implemented data access service to Create, Read, Update and Delete data (CRUD)<br>

**I will be adding CSS later, to make the site look better**
